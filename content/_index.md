My passion is designing and implementing innovative solutions. 

My [current research interests]({{< ref "luctus-urna.md" >}}) are focused on health literacy and communication with the goal of advocacy and community empowerment. With my [previous experience]({{< ref "ipsum-in.md" >}}) I've worked diligently to innovate and pioneer in fields that are often filled with antiquated practices. As the founder of two start-ups, Health Education Advocacy Link and Gratitude Bags, I hope to continue to pioneer in the entrepreneurship ecosystem, public health domain, and beyond. My work in these arenas has been [recognized]({{< ref "purus-sem.md" >}}) by local and national organizations.
