**My passion is designing and implementing innovative solutions for the greater good**

My [*current research interests*]({{< ref "luctus-urna.md" >}}) are focused on health literacy and communication with the goal of advocacy and community empowerment. With my [*previous experience,*]({{< ref "ipsum-in.md" >}}) I've worked diligently to innovate and pioneer in fields that are often filled with antiquated practices. As the founder of two start-ups, Health Education Advocacy Link and Gratitude Bags, I hope to continue to pioneer in the entrepreneurship ecosystem, public health domain, and beyond. My work in these arenas has been [*recognized*]({{< ref "purus-sem.md" >}}) by local and national organizations.
