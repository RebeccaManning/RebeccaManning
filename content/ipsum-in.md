Employer: Tammie Edwards [tlgortne@owu.edu] 

Position: Chemistry Stock Room Assistant

Description: The Ohio Wesleyan Chemistry Stock Room engages students who are interested in Chemistry. The chemistry stock room assistants help prepare the general and organic chemistry laboratories for new experiments each week. This role includes making and titrating solutions, confirming or correcting the molarity of each solution, filling necessary experimental supplies, understanding chemical storage systems, managing laboratory drawers, and keeping track of broken, lost, or missing glassware. In addition, I was mentored by Tammie Edwards, who taught me how to pull spotters for the organic chemistry labs.


**Place of Employment: Ohio Wesleyan Department of Theatre and Dance**

**Place of Employment: Ohio Wesleyan Department of Chemistry**

(August 2015- May 2016)

Employer: Ashley Hejmanowski [aqhejman@owu.edu]

Position: Chemical Hygiene Clerk

Description: The Chemical Hygiene Clerk is a member of the Student Assistantship Program (StAP) at Ohio Wesleyan University. One student from each department is selected to fulfil this role annually. The chemical hygiene clerk is responsible for managing Vertere, which is a chemical management software utilized by the department of chemistry. In addition, this role deepens your understanding of the composition and reactivity of the items stored within each lab. Professor Hejmanowski was also a great mentor. Under her encouragement, I created a comprehensive chemical storage system. 

**Place of Employment: Ohio Wesleyan Department of Technology**

(Summer August 2015- May 2016)

Employer: VIPKid Contractor

Position: English as a Second Language (ESL) Teacher

Description: ESL instructors must have a 4 year college degree and teaching experience. I received my ESL certification through the TESOL-VIPKid Foundational Teacher’s Extended Learning Program. I earned certifications to teach children new to the platform and levels 3 (age 6-12), 4 (age 7-12), and 5 (age 8-12). My classroom focused on the application of vocabulary and improving conversation skills. Topics ranged from landforms, inventions and technology, culture, history, reading comprehension and math. I taught 290 classes and fostered 112 brilliant minds. 


**Place of Employment: Case Western Reserve University**

(July 2017-Present)

Employer: Environmental Health & Safety

Position: Chemical and Biological Safety Specialist; Ergonomist

Description: The Department of Environmental Health & Safety is the regulatory and compliance center for all affiliated Case laboratories. I inspect assigned laboratory spaces across a wide variety of disciplines and specialties, teach laboratory safety training, serve as the university ergonomist to staff, students, and researchers, respond to on-campus emergencies related to occupational health risks in various settings, and lead the compressed gas safety program. The largest and most important component of my job involves authorizing non-laboratory personnel on campus to conduct work in laboratory spaces or touch equipment confined or previously used in a laboratory setting. A clearance form must be signed and posted by the health physics specialist and myself prior to any work. Applicable hazards are also communicated to personnel prior any work. In addition, I coordinate all laboratory relocations and decommissioning on campus, which includes welcoming new researchers to the university and assisting departing faculty and researchers. 


**Ohio Wesleyan Summer Science Research Program (SSRP): Novel Oxidative Chemistry Initiated by Ozone**

Abstract: Ketals are commonly employed protecting groups in organic chemistry. Ozone, a powerful oxidant, has not been broadly employed in ketal deprotection, but preliminary evidence suggests that oxidative deprotection of ketals using ozone might be feasible. However, further research needs to be done.  Three ketals (1-3) were synthesized to test this deprotection method.  The products were purified via recrystallization and column chromatography.  Thin layer chromatography and both 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy were used for characterization.  The ozonation of ketal (1) was investigated at -78˚C, both with dry ozonation on silica and in solution. Ozone was produced for these reactions by an ozone generator. Unexpectedly, oxidation of the phenyl ring occurred producing a carboxylic acid (4). Additional studies directed at better
