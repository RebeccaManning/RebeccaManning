title: Research Interests

Growing up, I saw an abundance of preventable disease states leading to negative health outcomes for those within my community. Through my experience and career in higher education, I aspire to drive health care in a direction where patients feel like they are at the center of their care. 

With a concentration in Population Health Research, my research interests include data analysis of community-based intervention metrics, mapping disparity and longitudinal health outcomes, and Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR). 

As an Environmental Health & Safety Professional, I specialize in communicating hazards to lay populations and research personnel. I am skilled in creating and conducting trainings, as well as designing and running programs to stand as a standardized institutional protocol. EHS specialists are essential to research operations, making them adept in emergency response, adaptability, working in a team, as well as leading a team. My role as an Ergonomist has given me the opportunity to craft and implement programing that impacts the well-being of others.
