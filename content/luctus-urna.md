title: Research Interests

Growing up, I saw an abundance of preventable disease states leading to negative health outcomes for those within my community. Through my experience and career in higher education, I have aspired to drive health care in a direction where patients feel like they are at the center of their care. 

With a concentration in Population Health Research, my academic interests include data analysis of community-based intervention metrics, mapping disparity and longitudinal health outcomes, and Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR). 

As an Environmental Health & Safety Professional, I specialize in communicating hazards to lay populations and research personnel. I am skilled in designing and running programs and creating and conducting trainings that establish and standardize institutional protocol. EHS specialists are essential to various research operations, making them highly adaptable and adept in emergency response, teamwork, and leadership. Moreover, my concurrent role as an Ergonomist has given me the opportunity to craft and implement programming that improves not only the posture of others, but also their well-being.
